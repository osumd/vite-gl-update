            Body:
                Reccursion begins with the inital condition, and given a rule defined by its previous iterations so that the nth term of the recursive
                function can be solved. 
                Lame's Theorem for example analizes the number of divisions it takes to get to the greatest common denominator of two integer values,
                the Euclidean algorithm uses recursion with a base case being that the remainder from the current iteration is zero, and that subsequently 
                remainders are computed until this base case is reached.

            Body:
                Recurrence relation text flys into left corner, a fish tank spawnes in the center
                the fishtank is mapped to a 3d grid for fish placements
