# Event System
## More Attributes
Need look at interpolation, need scaling, euler rotation quaternions etc.
## How to manage disposable or temporal length of objects.
Could potentially just zero scale use color for opacity., could these be added
to a reusable asset bin for events which
need similar disposable objects.
### Algorithm Idea
Set creation event up for example text.
generate disposable, a three text object is positioned and oriented and then the time line head reaches the end of the event with "disposable objects" in it, then it adds that transparent or zero size object into an array which the the others can draw on.
